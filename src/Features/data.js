  description: `Hi, I’m Omar, a Front-End Developer who loves turning ideas into smooth, beautiful, and easy-to-use web experiences. I work mainly with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, and React Query, always trying to write clean and practical code that people can rely on.

I enjoy solving problems and learning new things — whether it’s fixing tricky bugs, exploring new tools like Shadcn/UI and Zod, or finding smarter ways to build features.

I’ve learned a lot from hands-on projects and internships, especially about teamwork, thinking critically, and improving every day. My goal is to keep growing, contribute to real projects, and create work that really matters.`,
